# `alan` RFCs

This directory houses the RFCs that have been accepted.

RFCs must be proposed by PR on this repository, based on [the RFC template](https://github.com/alantech/alan/blob/master/rfcs/000%20-%20RFC%20Template.md).

Once an RFC has been landed, it is not changed *except* to add metadata about the RFC, such as the time the RFC was implemented, or if it was revoked and/or superceded by another RFC. All relevant metadata is located at the top of the RFC document to quickly tell if it is still relevant or not.
