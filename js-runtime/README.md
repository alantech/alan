# js-runtime

Runtime support for transpiled alan code in Javascript

## Usage

Make sure you `npm install alan-js-runtime` in any Node project that uses an `alan-compiler` Javascript output.

For the web, [browserify](http://browserify.org/) is an easy to use tool for bundling this runtime with your project, though you can use any such tool.
