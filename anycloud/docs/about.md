The [AnyCloud](https://anycloudapp.com) CLI takes cloud provider credentials and a `Dockerfile` to elastically scale any kind of HTTP server in your own cloud account.

## Setup

* [Install](install.md) the CLI
* [Authenticate](authenticate.md) the CLI

## Documentation

* The initial [tutorial](tutorials/aws-node.md) will guide you from 0 to a sample Node.js HTTP server deployed in your AWS account. Start here if youâ€™re new to AnyCloud.
* [How-to guides](how-to/README.md) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They assume some knowledge of how AnyCloud works.
* [Technical reference](reference/README.md) for built-in APIs and JSON file configuration schemas.
