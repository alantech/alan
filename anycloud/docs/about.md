# AnyCloud Documentation

[AnyCloud](https://github.com/alantech/anycloud/blob/main/README.md) takes API credentials from your preferred cloud provider and a `Dockerfile` in order to elastically scale an HTTP server in your own cloud provider account.

## About the documentation

A high-level overview of how the AnyCloud documentation is organized will help you know how to quickly find what you are looking for:

* The [Tutorial](tutorial.md) will guide you from 0 to a sample Node.js HTTP server deployed in your AWS account with AnyCloud. Start here if youâ€™re new to AnyCloud.
* [How-to guides](how-to/README.md) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than the tutorial and assume some knowledge of how AnyCloud works.
* [Technical reference](reference/README.md) for built-in APIs and JSON file configuration schemas. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume some knowledge of how AnyCloud works
