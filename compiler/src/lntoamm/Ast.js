    // If the dependency is a global dependency, there's a more complicated resolution to find it.
    // This is inspired by the Ruby and Node resolution mechanisms, but with some changes that
    // should hopefully make some improvements so dependency-injection is effectively first-class
    // and micro-libraries are discouraged (the latter will require a multi-pronged effort)
    //
    // Essentially, there are two recursively-found directories that global modules can be found,
    // the `modules` directory and the `dependencies` directory (TBD: are these the final names?)
    // The `modules` directory is recursively checked first (with a special check to make sure it
    // ignores self-resolutions) and the first one found in that check, if any, is used. If not,
    // there's a special check if the dependency is an `@std/...` dependency, and if so to return
    // that string as-is so the built-in dependency is used. Next the same recursive check is
    // performed on the `dependencies` directories until the dependency is found. If that also
    // fails, then there will be a complaint and the process will exit.
    //
    // The idea is that the package manager will install dependencies into the `dependencies`
    // directory at the root of the project (or maybe PWD, but that seems a bit too unwieldy).
    // Meanwhile the `modules` directory will only exist if the developer wants it, but it can be
    // useful for cross-cutting code in the same project that doesn't really need to be open-
    // sourced but is annoying to always reference slightly differently in each file, eg
    // `../../../util`. Instead the project can have a project-root-level `modules` directory and
    // then `modules/util.ln` can be referenced simply with `import @util` anywhere in the project.
    //
    // Since this is also recursive, it's should make dependency injection a first-class citizen
    // of the language. For instance you can put all of your models in `modules/models/`, and then
    // your unit test suite can have its model mocks in `tests/modules/models/` and the dependency
    // you intend to inject into can be symlinked in the `tests/` directory to cause that version
    // to pull the injected code, instead. And of course, if different tests need different
    // dependency injections, you can turn the test file into a directory of the same name and
    // rename the file to `index.ln` within it, and then have the specific mocks that test needs
    // stored in a `modules/` directory in parallel with it, which will not impact other mocks.
    //
    // Because these mocks also have a special exception to not import themselves, this can also
    // be used for instrumentation purposes, where they override the actual module but then also
    // import the real thing and add extra behavior to it.
    //
    // While there are certainly uses for splitting some logical piece of code into a tree of
    // files and directories, it is my hope that the standard application organization path is a
    // project with a root `index.ln` file and `modules` and `dependencies` directories, and little
    // else. At least things like `modules/logger`, `modules/config`, etc should belong there.
