  // If the dependency is a global dependency, there's a more complicated resolution to find it.
  // This is inspired by the Ruby and Node resolution mechanisms, but with some changes that
  // should hopefully make some improvements so dependency-injection is effectively first-class
  // and micro-libraries are discouraged (the latter will require a multi-pronged effort)
  //
  // Essentially, there are two recursively-found directories that global modules can be found,
  // the `modules` directory and the `dependencies` directory (TBD: are these the final names?)
  // The `modules` directory is recursively checked first (with a special check to make sure it
  // ignores self-resolutions) and the first one found in that check, if any, is used. If not,
  // there's a special check if the dependency is an `@std/...` dependency, and if so to return
  // that string as-is so the built-in dependency is used. Next the same recursive check is
  // performed on the `dependencies` directories until the dependency is found. If that also
  // fails, then there will be a complaint and the process will exit.
  //
  // The idea is that the package manager will install dependencies into the `dependencies`
  // directory at the root of the project (or maybe PWD, but that seems a bit too unwieldy).
  // Meanwhile the `modules` directory will only exist if the developer wants it, but it can be
  // useful for cross-cutting code in the same project that doesn't really need to be open-
  // sourced but is annoying to always reference slightly differently in each file, eg
  // `../../../util`. Instead the project can have a project-root-level `modules` directory and
  // then `modules/util.ln` can be referenced simply with `import @util` anywhere in the project.
  //
  // Since this is also recursive, it's should make dependency injection a first-class citizen
  // of the language. For instance you can put all of your models in `modules/models/`, and then
  // your unit test suite can have its model mocks in `tests/modules/models/` and the dependency
  // you intend to inject into can be symlinked in the `tests/` directory to cause that version
  // to pull the injected code, instead. And of course, if different tests need different
  // dependency injections, you can turn the test file into a directory of the same name and
  // rename the file to `index.ln` within it, and then have the specific mocks that test needs
  // stored in a `modules/` directory in parallel with it, which will not impact other mocks.
  //
  // Because these mocks also have a special exception to not import themselves, this can also
  // be used for instrumentation purposes, where they override the actual module but then also
  // import the real thing and add extra behavior to it.
  //
  // While there are certainly uses for splitting some logical piece of code into a tree of
  // files and directories, it is my hope that the standard application organization path is a
  // project with a root `index.ln` file and `modules` and `dependencies` directories, and little
  // else. At least things like `modules/logger`, `modules/config`, etc should belong there.
